# FoodSafe
Take health inspection data and make it easier for people to digest. (Pun fully intended.)

FoodSafe is a project to learn about scraping and hosting the results using Python. We intend to do some public good in the process and make health inspection scores easier to access.

This project will be done in 3 parts.

1. Scraping data from municipal sites using Scrapy.
2. Creating an API with Flask to serve the data.
3. Creating a frontend with React/Redux to consume the data from the API.

We're just getting started so pardon the dust.
